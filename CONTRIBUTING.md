# Contributing Guidelines

### Process for submitting updates
  1. Create or log into your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
  2. [Fork the harvard-acmg.github.io repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) into your Github account.
  3. Clone your fork of harvard-acmg.github.io to your computer system.
  4. Add your modifications into a [new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) off the **main** branch.
  5. Test your website updates thoroughly.  We recommend using a couple of different browsers on both computer and mobile devices to check  if the web pages render properly.
  6. Create a [pull request in GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
  7. The [GEOS-Chem Support Team](https://geoschem.github.io/support-team.html) will merge your updates into the main branch.  Once this happens, your updates will be visible on the web.
  8. If your website updates break existing functionality, the GCST will request that you take further corrective action.
